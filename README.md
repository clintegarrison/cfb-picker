# cfb-picker

priorities
- get totals working
- start recording in the concepts of weeks
- have a service check the DB for the week's picks, hit a service to get game results, then increment/decrement credits... maybe set this up on a recurring schedule so that it updates shortly after the game ends
- don't allow a pick after the game has started
- don't allow a pick to be deleted after the game has started
- don't allow multiple picks for the same bet
- show game scores live on the myPicks page (call service from page)
